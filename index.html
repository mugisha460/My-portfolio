    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a Financial and Health Literacy Coach with over 5 years of experience empowering communities across Uganda and East Africa. My work focuses on bridging the gap between financial stability and personal well-being by delivering practical, culturally relevant education. Through coaching, workshops, and digital platforms, I help individuals, youth, and families make informed choices about money management, disease prevention, and healthy living. My mission is to equip people with the knowledge and tools they need to achieve long-term wellness and build resilient, financially empowered communities.
